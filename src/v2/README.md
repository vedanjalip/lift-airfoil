## Parameter values

-	`ambientTemperature`: 281.65 K
-	`ambientPressure`   : 88375.17 Pa
-	`chordLength`       : 0.095 m to 0.105 m
-	`deltaColumnHeight` : 0.095 m to 0.105 m

The empirical data[^1] represented in ```lookup-table.md``` is used to estimate the value of the lift coefficient based on the value of the Reynolds number. The estimation is done using a combination of linear and parabolic interpolation. Using these quantities, a uniform distribution has been chosen to be a method to insert uncertainty in the measurement of the lift coefficient.
